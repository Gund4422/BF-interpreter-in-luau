# The Interpreter

Most “Luau in Luau” projects are huge — 200 KB+ monstrosities.  
I wanted something smaller, crazier, and completely unique.  

So I made **Brainf-ck in Luau**.

This isn’t just an interpreter — it’s a **fully interactive Brainf-ck IDE** for Roblox Player:  
- Live memory tape visualization  
- Input and output handling  
- Slow execution for watching the program step-by-step  
- Lightweight, fast, and runs outside Studio for maximum performance  

If you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to run a Turing-complete language inside Roblox… now you know.
